"""Gemini Live configuration and tool execution for voice calls.

The live call bypasses the text agents entirely (no orchestrator, no hooks), so
this module carries the persona + safety rules in the system prompt and executes
a voice-suitable subset of ``tool.py`` directly against the SAME Agent Kernel
session the text chat uses (session id = the caller's phone number). That is the
cross-channel guarantee: consent given on a call is honoured in chat and vice versa.

    "This is speech, not text. Never say formatting characters: no asterisks, bullets, or headings. "

    "read a list of appliances aloud; name the top two and stop. Never spell out tool names.\n"
    "Data rules: never work out units, bills, or savings yourself. Call the tools and say their "
    "numbers. Every figure is an estimate based on the published CEB and LECO domestic tariff, not "
